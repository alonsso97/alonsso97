## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I love cybersecurity and I am currently working as an Analyst in a Security Operations Center. 

The published repositories were created while I was studying system administration, and during that time, I began learning the Bash scripting language.

Currently, I am learning and improving my skills in Python and PowerShell.
